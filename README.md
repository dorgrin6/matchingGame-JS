# matchingGame-JS

### This is a simple find the diffrences style game I made to implement my knowledge from a [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript/).

To play just download the folder and press the html file.

## How to play
Press the extra smiling face which is found in the left side of the screen but not the right.
